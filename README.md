# API Scavenger Hunt

## Setup

1. Clone down this repo
1. Change into the cloned directory
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Start the server by running `node server.js`

## Your Quest

Use this [repl link to begin](https://repl.it/languages/babel), start by making a GET request to `http://localhost:3001/`, and then use the clues from the responses to find your way through the API from there.

Your ultimate goal is to be able to console log the message "Congrats, you made it!".
