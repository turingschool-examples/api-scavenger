# API Scavenger Hunt

## Setup

1. Clone down this repo
1. Change into the cloned directory
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Start the server by running `node server.js`

## Your Quest

In a [repl](https://repl.it/languages/babel), tart by making a fetch call to `localhost:3000/`, and find your way through the API from there.

Your ultimate goal is to be able to console log the message "Congrats, you made it!".
